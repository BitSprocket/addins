Compile Controller ReadMe
November 1999


This is the package that goes with the article on the Compile Controller in the November 1999 issue of VBPJ. There are four example directories and a directory containing the source code for the add-in. The add-in and all the examples have both source code and compiled binaries. The guide to doing the examples is saved both in Word97 and text format in the directory containing this file (Compile Controller Guide.doc).

The add-in itself, called CompileController.dll, and its installer are in the add-in source directory. You may want to copy these binaries to another location before installing the add-in.
