Title: CodeHelp 1.2.2 (Tabbed IDE code editor Window) Updated
Description: This is a VB AddIn, with this AddIn VB can show the Code editor windows in tabbed style.
Much like the code editor in VS.NET IDE or Opera Browser.
As usual thanks to Paul Caton for his superb Subclassing class.
Just compile the project and then restart VB IDE to see it in action.
Tested and developed under WinXP SP 1, now also works in Win98.
