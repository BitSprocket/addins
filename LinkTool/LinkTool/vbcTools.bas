' MVBLC Link Control Tool:   Module "vbcTools"
'=======================================================
'
'  This module has some DLL utility functions:
'
'  a) GETEXPORTS: reads the newly linked DLL's Export
'       Table (VBC "STATUS" option).
'
'  b) FIXDLL: looks at the DLL file to see if it imports
'       functions from the "fixed" DLL name hardcoded in
'       the Type Library "vbLibrary.TLB".  We "fix"
'       the DLL by changing that fixed name to be the
'       real name of the DLL itself.
