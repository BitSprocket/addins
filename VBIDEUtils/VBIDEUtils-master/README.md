Update 04 Feb 2016: Compiled binaries from the original author are now available in the root folder.  As with any precompiled files, use at your own risk.  Per Thierry69's instructions, "in order to add it to the list of addins, the user must call the AddToINI in the immediate window."

Update 06 October 2015: Please note that I am not the author of this code.  "Thierry69" is the owner and author of the code, and it is reproduced here at his request.  This repository is primarily a mirror of the original VBIDEUtils source, as uploaded here: http://www.vbforums.com/showthread.php?806227-VBIDEUtils-now-open-sources

I am happy to merge any improvements or updates, but questions should be directed to Thierry69 himself.  I do not have contact information other than his vbForums profile: http://www.vbforums.com/member.php?244339-Thierry69

VBCodeDatabase is an external application and have exactly the same functions than the Code repository in the VBIDEUtils. The database is full compatible. It has been created for the users wich don't want the full add-ins, but only the code repository.


Target platforms
----------------

Visual Basic 5.0, Visual Basic 6.0

You need Microsoft® Visual Basic® 5.0 Service Pack 3 or higher 
in order to run properly. If you need a version without any 
service pack, it is possible, you have to contact me in that case.

you will be able to :
    - Store all your VB libraries (VB Script, JavaScript...)      
      in categories
    - Identify immediately the type of the stored item
    - You can store HTML page in the database
    - You can store HTML links to page, files...

System Requirements
-------------------
You need a computer running Microsoft® Windows 95/98® or Microsoft® Windows NT®.
Microsoft® Visual Basic® 5.0 (Service Pack 3) or Higher with all the runtime installed and 
an installation of Internet Explorer 3.0 or 4.0 or higher installed.


Installation
------------

Just start the program "Install.EXE". Once it is done, start your VB, you have a new toolbar, 
and new items in the Edit Menu and in the contextual menu of your Code window.


Problems
--------

You need to install the Service Pack 3 of VB 5.0 for VB 5.0 in order 
to run correctly this version. If you don't have installed SVP3, consider installing the Service Pack 3 of Microsoft. 
It is free. you can find it on the web site of Microsoft.

If you have problems during the installation or the execution of this add-in, 
this is probably due to the fact that you didn't have installed all the DLL 
from your VB 5.0 or VB 6.0

Try install all the DLL (including the DAO). 
If the problem still exists, contact me and I will solve the problem with you.


Conclusion
----------

Thank you for taking the time to download VBIDEUtils. 
I hope you find it to be of use in your development efforts. 
Please let me know how it can be made better!
