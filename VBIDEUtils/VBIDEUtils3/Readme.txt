This sample provides an all VB ActiveX in process DLL which can
create an unlimited number of popup menus, all with full icon support.
No longer do you need a form with menus on to get a Popup menu!  Not
just that but you can create as many menus as you want without 
needing a root VB menu, and each menu you create can have unlimited
sub menus.

This ZIP contains full source code for the DLL and the DLL itself.

You are free to distribute cnewmenu.zip in it's original state to any

do not distribute modified versions of cNewMenu.DLL under the same

If you wish to distribute cnewmenu.zip by any other means (i.e. if 
you want to include it on a CD or any other software media) then the
