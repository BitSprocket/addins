/*
|*  ActiveX Documenter
\*

Description
-----------

This all-VB application uses TLBINF32.DLL (the one used by VB's object browser) 
to investigate the interfaces of compiled ActiveX documents. 
This release allows you to quickly browse an ActiveX object's members, 
copy the member definitions as fully formatted VB code 
to your own application and also creates a superb documentation template 
using the procedure attributes built into the ActiveX object's Type Lib. 
This is a must download if you're trying to create help files 
for your ActiveX objects. 
The next release (due in August) will be even more powerful - 
you'll be able to create Superclasses of existing ActiveX objects, 
choosing where you want to delegate interfaces, 
and it will generate fully hyperlinked HTML documentation. 
Includes full source code, with some serious features- all-VB RichEdit, 
Rebar and Toolbar controls.
