' so after a solid day of hard labor hooking the api and working out all the bugs..i find
' vb6 has a built in event that fires to prompt for a file name and can override it.
' i never imagined they would have a hook for that built in..sooo, anyway I will include this
' module, even though it isnt used, but it might come in handy someday and I am not going to
' lose the work..
'
' live and learn!
